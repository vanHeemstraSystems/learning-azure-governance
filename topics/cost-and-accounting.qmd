Design a governance solution

Requirements

Tailwind Traders is planning on making some significant changes to their governance solution. They have asked for your assistance with recommendations and questions. Here are the specific requirements.

Tailwind Traders has two main business units that handle Apparel and Sporting Goods. Each of the business units consist of three departments: Product Development, Marketing, and Sales. Each business unit and subunit will be responsible for tracking their Azure spend. At the same time, the Enterprise IT team will be responsible for providing company-wide Azure cost reporting.

Tasks

- What are different ways Tailwind Traders could organize their subscriptions and management groups. Which would be the best to meet their requirements?

- Design two alternative hierarchies and explain your decision-making process.
